                          CHORUS AND SOLO (Florian)
                      "Search throughout the panorama"
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

Chorus:      Search throughout the panorama
            For a sign of royal Gama,
                 Who to-day should cross the water
                 With his fascinating daughter—
                       Ida is her name.
<br>
<br>
            Some misfortune evidently
            Has detained them — consequently
                 Search throughout the panorama
                 For the daughter of King Gama,
                       Prince Hilarion's flame!
                       Prince Hilarion's flame!

                               SOLO - Florian
<br>
<br>
Florian:     Will Prince Hilarion's hopes be sadly blighted?
<br>
<br>
Chorus:                             Who can tell?  Who can tell?
<br>
<br>
Florian:     Will Ida break the vows that she has plighted?

Chorus:                             Who can tell?  Who can tell?

Florian:     Will she back out, and say she did not mean them?

Chorus:                             Who can tell?

Florian:     If so, there'll be the deuce to pay between them!

Chorus:           No, no — we'll not despair, we'll not despair,
                 For Gama would not dare
                 To make a deadly foe
                 Of Hildebrand, and so,
                       Search through the panorama
                       For a sign of royal Gama,
                       Who today should cross the water
                       With his fascinating daughter—
                       Ida, Ida is her name.

                                           (Enter King Hildebrand
with Cyril)
<br>
<br>
Hildebd:     See you no sign of Gama?

Florian:                            None, my liege!

Hildebd:     It's very odd indeed.  If Gama fail
            To put in an appearance at our Court
            Before the sun has set in yonder west,
            And fail to bring the Princess Ida here
            To whom our son Hilarion was betrothed
            At the extremely early age of one,
            There's war between King Gama and ourselves!
                 (aside to Cyril)
            Oh, Cyril, how I dread this interview!
            It's twenty years since he and I have met.
            He was a twisted monster — all awry——
            As though Dame Nature, angry with her work,
            Had crumpled it in fitful petulance!
<br>
<br>
Cyril:       But, sir, a twisted and ungainly trunk
            Often bears goodly fruit.  Perhaps he was
            A kind, well-spoken gentleman?

Hildebd:                                        Oh, no!
            For, adder-like, his sting lay in his tongue.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style ="color:red">(His "sting" is present, though his "stung" is past.)</span>
<br>
<br>
Florian:     (looking through glass)
            But stay, my liege; o'er yonder mountain's brow
            Comes a small body, bearing Gama's arms;
            And now I look more closely at it, sir,
            I see attached to it King Gama's legs;
            From which I gather this corollary
            That that small body must be Gama's own!

Hildebd:     Ha! Is the Princess with him?

Florian:                                  Well, my liege,
                 Unless her highness is full six feet high,
            And wears mustachios too — and smokes cigars——
            And rides en cavalier in coat of steel——
            I do not think she is.
