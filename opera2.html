                    On every hand, on every hand——</p>

  <p class="speech"><h5 class="CHO">CHO</h5>                       To your command,
                                On every hand,
                          We dutifully bow.</p>

 <p class="speech"> <h5 class="HIL">HIL</h5>         If Gama bring the Princess here,
                    Give him good cheer, give him good cheer.</p>

  <p class="song"> <h5 class="CHO">CHO</h5>                     
                 If she come here
                                We'll give him a cheer,
                          And we will show you how.
                    Hip, hip, hurrah! hip, hip, hurrah!
                    Hip, hip, hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!
                                We'll shout and sing
                                Long live the King,
                          And his daughter, too, I trow!
                    Then shout ha! ha! hip, hip, hurrah!
                    Hip, hip, hip, hip, hurrah!
                    For the fair Princess and her good papa,
                          Hurrah, hurrah!</p>
